# Finsweet Website (Figma Community Project)

This repository contains the code for the Finsweet website, a project developed by CodeBreakers, inspired by the Finsweet design available in the Figma community.

## Project Overview

The Finsweet website brings the Finsweet design to life, showcasing the creativity and expertise of the CodeBreakers team in web development. Our goal is to create a fully functional and visually appealing website using modern web technologies.
